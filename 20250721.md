I’ve roughly grasped how to use hash tables.
For the second exercise, I tried a new method using only one hash table.
For the first exercise, I was thinking about how to sort the output alphabetically, but I ran out of time.
I’ll continue tomorrow.
Today was a bit busy — went to the gym and did some shopping, so I didn’t get through as many problems as I’d planned, but it was a solid start.
I feel like my problem-solving thought process still needs improvement.
